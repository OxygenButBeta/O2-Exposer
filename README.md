# O2.Exposer

`O2.Exposer` is a lightweight, high-performance member access library that enables fast runtime access to fields and properties of any object ‚Äî without the overhead of slow reflection calls.

Traditional reflection in .NET can be slow and impact application performance, especially when accessing members repeatedly. `O2.Exposer` solves this by generating and caching delegate-based getters and setters for each member, ensuring:

- Reflection is performed only once per type (type caching)
- Each member‚Äôs getter/setter delegate is compiled once and reused indefinitely (delegate caching)

It also offers advanced filtering capabilities, allowing you to expose members based on access level (public/private), attributes, and accessibility rules. This makes it a perfect choice for creating serialization systems, debugging tools, runtime inspectors, and other utilities where dynamic and efficient member access is critical.

## Key Features
-üîç Access by Name: Access private and public fields and properties via string names.
-‚ö° High Performance: Reflection is only used once per member type. Afterwards, access is done through compiled delegates, completely reflection-free and with zero GC allocations.
-üß† Smart Caching: Caches types, members, and delegates for maximum runtime performance.
-üßπ GC-Free Access: No boxing or allocations during get/set operations ‚Äî ideal for performance-critical applications.
-üéØ Flexible Filtering: Filter exposed members by:
Access level (private, public, etc.)
Attributes (e.g. [SerializeField])
Accessibility (read/write)
üß© Clean Value Access: Get/set directly via .Value, with full type safety.
üõ° Interface-Based Control: Restrict access via IExposedGetOnly<T> or IExposedSetOnly<T> interfaces.

## üì¶ Installation

Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/OxygenButBeta/O2.Exposer/releases) page.

Extract the package and add the DLL file (`O2.Exposer.dll`) to your project references manually

## üìå Sample Usage & üöÄ Quick Start

### Using ExposedGroup<T> (Recommended for Accessing Multiple Members)

```csharp
ExposedGroup<TargetType> exposedGroup = new(TargetInstance);
```
### Configure Optional Filters to Control Which Members Are Exposed
```csharp
ExposerFilter exposerFilter = new ExposerFilter {
    GetterRequired = true,
    SetterRequired = true,
    RequiredAttributes = [
        typeof(PreserveBaseOverridesAttribute),
        typeof(CompilerGeneratedAttribute)
        // Add any other required attributes here
    ],
    AccessModifiers = AccessModifierTarget.Public | AccessModifierTarget.Protected | AccessModifierTarget.Internal
};
```
### Create an Exposed Group with Filters
```csharp
ExposedGroup<TargetType> filteredGroup = new ExposedGroup<TargetType>(TargetInstance, exposerFilter);
```
### Retrieve a Member by Name and Expected Type
```csharp
ExposedMember<string, TargetType> fieldExposed = exposedGroup.GetMember<string>("fieldName");
```
### Convert Exposed Member into Interfaces with Restricted Access
```csharp
IGetterOnlyMember<string, TargetType> readOnly = fieldExposed.AsReadOnly();
ISetterOnlyMember<string, TargetType> writeOnly = fieldExposed.AsSetOnly();
```
### Expose a Property or Field by Name Without Filters
```csharp
ExposedMember<int, TargetType> intField = ExposedMember<int, TargetType>.Expose("GetIntField", TargetInstance);
```
